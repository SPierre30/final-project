### Java Web Coding
- My design is going to show what type of basic coding I have learned this term. My plan is to build a web page that will have various small codes written throughout. Most of the codes will be in java along with some bootstrapping, as well as the html and css coding that would normally be present in any basic web page. The page itself (although generated through GitHub pages) will be reworked by me to fit my needs along the lines of the visual aspect of the whole design.

### Continuing my programming knowledge
- Basically I will be continuing to practice small coding and implementation into designs. Also this project will help me out with github’s branch, sync, merge, pull concept, which every time I think I have it down the desktop app throw’s me through another loop :smiley_face: I have learned quite a bit through this course and as unsure as i was about taking this class as an online course, I am quite pleased with my choice. Thank you @hectorsector I enjoyed it

### Timing
- I have a basic start on my web page with only a couple days of work into it (I would say around 5-6 hrs total thus far). To complete my design with full implementation should take me around a weeks time :pray:

### Ideas and Suggestions
- I always appreciate any type of critiquing on my work no matter how big or small it may seem. Please feel free to leave any feedback, even if it may come across as being negative. I like to take all suggestions and use them to build from
