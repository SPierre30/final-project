I don't have much to say on the first part of this. Basically I'm going to be using the most popular
pokemon as the answers for this quiz. First we use the amount of letters in your
 name and it's added to the total. The other questions will add numbers to the overall total. I'm goint to be using
 an input radio with values attached. At the end when you click submit,
  an image of your pokemon depending on the value with a picture and music will appear.
