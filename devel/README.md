# Instructions for Running my Project

The prpject itself is fairly simple. Navigate to my [webpage](https://marxspawn.github.io/webBasedJavaDemo/). ON the page itself are various buttons that you (the viewer) can interactively click to see how coding can be implemented into HTML.

## Instructions for running the Live Code portion
- There will be a link that the viewer can navigate to with a demo code already displayed. 
  - Clicking the generate code button will display the code in use.
- Along with runnng the example code the viewer can:
  - delete the example code and insert a code of their own
  - Then by pressing the generate code button view a live demo of the code in use
